# InboxGuard - Email Phishing Detection Pipeline

InboxGuard is a pipeline designed to detect phishing emails in Gmail accounts. It automates email extraction, phishing detection using a machine learning model, and Gmail actions (e.g., labeling emails as phishing, suspicious, or safe).

## üéØ Overview

The pipeline consists of the following components:

1. **Email Extraction**: Extracts emails from a Gmail account using IMAP.
2. **Phishing Detection**: Analyzes emails using a machine learning model to classify them as:
   - **Phishing** (1): Malicious emails attempting to steal information.
   - **Legitimate** (0): Safe emails.
   - **Suspicious** (-1): Emails with uncertain classification.
3. **Gmail Actions**: Labels emails in Gmail based on the classification results.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The pipeline is divided into three services:

1. **Email Service**:

   - Extracts emails from Gmail and saves them as JSON.
   - Located in the `email-service` directory.

2. **Model Service**:

   - A FastAPI-based microservice that uses a machine learning model to classify emails.
   - Located in the `model-service` directory.

3. **Actions Service**:
   - Reads classification results and performs actions on Gmail (e.g., labeling emails).
   - Located in the `actions-service` directory.

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.11** or higher.
2. **Docker** (optional, for running the model service in a container).
3. **Gmail App Password**:
   - Enable IMAP in your Gmail account settings.
   - Generate an app password if 2FA is enabled.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/InboxGuard/inboxGuard
cd inboxGuard
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Option 1: Using Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the Model Service

If you want to run the model service separately, you can use Docker:

```bash
python3 model-service/main.py
```

### Step 5: Make the Pipeline Script Executable

Ensure the inboxguard.sh script is executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x inboxguard.sh
```

### Step 6: Run the Pipeline Script

```bash
./inboxguard.sh -e email@gmail.com -p "your_app_password"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. Email Extraction

- The `email-service` extracts emails from Gmail and saves them as JSON files in `email-service/extracted_emails/emails.json`.

### 2. Phishing Detection

- The `model-service` analyzes the extracted emails and saves the classification results as JSON files in `model-service/responses/`.

### 3. Gmail Actions

- The `actions-service` reads the classification results and labels emails in Gmail based on the predictions.

## üìä Classification Results

Classification results are stored in the `model-service/responses/` directory. Each email is classified as:

- **Phishing (1):** Moved to the `Inboxguard/Phishing` label.
- **Suspicious (-1):** Moved to the `Inboxguard/Suspicious` label.
- **Legitimate (0):** Moved to the `Inboxguard/Safe` label.

## üìù Notes

- Ensure IMAP is enabled in your Gmail account.
- Use a Gmail app password for authentication.
- This pipeline is for educational and personal use only. Keep your credentials secure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Script Options

The `inboxguard.sh` script supports the following options:

### Core Options

- `-e, --email EMAIL`: Specifies the Gmail address to use for the pipeline.
- `-p, --password PASSWORD`: Specifies the Gmail app password (not the regular Gmail password).
- `-n, --num-emails NUM`: Specifies the number of emails to process (default is 10).
- `-h, --help`: Displays the help message with usage instructions.

### Execution Mode Options

The script supports three different execution modes, each with specific use cases:

- `-f, --fork`: Executes tasks using child processes (via `fork`).
- `-t, --threads`: Executes tasks using threads for parallel processing.
- `-s, --subshell`: Executes tasks in a subshell (isolated environment). **[Default]**

### Utility Options

- `-l, --log-dir DIR`: Specifies a custom directory for logging (default: `./logs`).
- `-r, --reset`: Resets parameters to default values (requires admin privileges).

## üîÑ Execution Modes Explained

### Why Different Execution Modes?

Different execution modes provide flexibility for various deployment scenarios and system requirements:

### üç¥ Fork Mode (`-f`)

**What it does**: Creates a separate child process to run the pipeline.

**When to use**:

- When you need process isolation for security
- For production environments where process crashes shouldn't affect the parent
- When running multiple pipelines simultaneously

**Advantages**:

- Complete process isolation
- Memory is not shared between processes
- If the pipeline crashes, it won't affect the main script

**Disadvantages**:

- Higher memory usage (separate process)
- Slightly slower startup time
- Inter-process communication overhead

### üßµ Threads Mode (`-t`)

**What it does**: Executes the pipeline in a background thread while maintaining shared memory space.

**When to use**:

- For better resource utilization
- When you need shared state between the main script and pipeline
- For faster execution with shared memory access

**Advantages**:

- Lower memory footprint (shared memory)
- Faster inter-thread communication
- Better for concurrent operations

**Disadvantages**:

- Less isolation (threads share memory)
- Potential for memory leaks affecting the entire process
- Threading complexity in Python (GIL limitations)

### üêö Subshell Mode (`-s`) - **Default**

**What it does**: Runs the pipeline in an isolated shell environment.

**When to use**:

- For development and testing (recommended default)
- When you need environment variable isolation
- For simple, straightforward execution

**Advantages**:

- Environment isolation (variables, working directory)
- Simple and reliable execution model
- Clean separation of execution context
- Default choice for most use cases

**Disadvantages**:

- Less control over the execution process
- Limited inter-process communication options

### Examples

- **Basic usage** (uses default subshell mode):

  ```bash
  ./inboxguard.sh -e user@gmail.com -p "your_app_password"
  ```

- **Process 20 emails with fork mode**:

  ```bash
  ./inboxguard.sh -f -e user@gmail.com -p "your_app_password" -n 20
  ```

- **Use threads mode for better performance**:

  ```bash
  ./inboxguard.sh -t -e user@gmail.com -p "your_app_password"
  ```

- **Explicit subshell mode with custom log directory**:

  ```bash
  ./inboxguard.sh -s -e user@gmail.com -p "your_app_password" -l /tmp/inboxguard_logs
  ```

- **Reset parameters to default** (requires admin privileges):
  ```bash
  sudo ./inboxguard.sh -r
  ```

## üéØ Choosing the Right Execution Mode

| Scenario                 | Recommended Mode | Reason                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Development/Testing**  | `-s` (subshell)  | Simple, isolated, reliable          |
| **Production/Security**  | `-f` (fork)      | Process isolation, crash protection |
| **Performance Critical** | `-t` (threads)   | Shared memory, faster execution     |
| **Multiple Pipelines**   | `-f` (fork)      | Independent processes               |
| **Resource Constrained** | `-t` (threads)   | Lower memory usage                  |
